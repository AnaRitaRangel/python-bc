## Integer (int)
# 1.	Develop a program that adds two numbers given by the user
print("SUM")
number1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Type aother number: "))
sum =  number1 + number2
print(f"The sum between {number1} and {number2} is {sum}")

# 2.	Develop a program that calculates the remainder of a division by five. 
print("REMAINDER OF A DIVISION")
number1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Type another number: "))
division_remainder =  number1 % number2
print(f"The remainder of the division between {number1} and {number2} is {division_remainder}")

# 3.	Develop a program that multiplies two numbers and shows the result.
print("MULTIPLICATION")
number1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Type another number: "))
times =  number1 * number2
print(f"The result of the multiplication between {number1} and {number2} is {times}")

# 4.	Develop a program that makes the integer division of the first by the second.
print("INTEGER DIVISION")
number1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Type another number: "))
integer_division =  number1 // number2
print(f"The result of the integer division between {number1} and {number2} is {integer_division}")

# 5.	Develop a program that calculates the square of a number.
print("SQUARE")
number1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
square =  number1 **2
print(f"The square of {number1} is {square}")
